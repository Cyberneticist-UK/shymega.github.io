Hi, I'm Dom. I'm a 20-something hobbyist programmer, advocate of open
source/free software, and interested in electronics.

In terms of software, you can see my Github [profile][gh] and my projects that I
work on. 

I do have a habit of starting projects, and then ending up with no
time/motivation to work on it -- rest assured,that does not necessarily mean
I've given up on them.

I'm also a hobbyist photographer, and enjoy taking landscape & candid
photographs.
